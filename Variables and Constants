Data comes in certain types such as strings or numbers or Booleans or dates. For example, age is a number whereas our DOB is a date. Our names are strings. Remember that: 
-    Strings store characters and numbers.
-    Booleans store True or False.
-    Numeric data types store only numbers (whole or fraction or mixed). 
-    Dates store date values such as todayâ€™s date or birthdays.
